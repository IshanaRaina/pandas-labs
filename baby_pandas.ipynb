    "# Basic Pandas\n",
    "## About\n",
    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an extremely powerful open-source Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools and is built on top of NumPy. If you are accessing, manipulating and analysing data with Python, there is no escaping the Pandas library!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "Even though Pandas has been installed on your machine, you need to `import` it into your working environment so that you can use its features and functionalities in your project. This is usually why data analytics projects start with all the required import statements. So that all the project dependencies are stated upfront and taken care of beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Pandas\n",
    "Even though you are free to choose any alias (that doesn't conflict with Python's keywords), it is common practice to import pandas as `pd`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "You're already familiar with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) so I'll leave you with an interesting feature: `%matplotlib inline`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interactive Python (IPython) kernel such as the one we're using here has the ability to display plots which are the output from running code cells. And it is designed to work hand-in-hand with the Matplotlib library in order to provide this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "`%matplotlib` is that magic command which sets up the seamless connection between IPython and Matplotlib. Without any arguments passed to it, the plots and graphs are rendered using the default backend - in a separate window. \n",
    "\n",
    "Passing `inline` as an argument changes the backend so that graphs are rendered inline, directly under the code cell that ran the command! You'll see what I mean as we go along the project but it's one of the features that'll get you hooked onto Jupyter notebooks, especially for prototyping your code."

    "### What's in a DataFrame?\n",
    "Let's think about a real-world example such as data that a company possesses about its customers. That information has to be stored somewhere so what do you think that data structure looks like? What features might the data structure contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I'm sure the information (whether stored in a relational table or Excel spreadsheet) has a **name.**\n",
    "> - There must be **columns** containing different identifiers such as `id`, `name`, `age`, `address`, `phone`, `email` and `join_date` to name a few.\n",
    "> - There must be **rows** (one per unique customer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The next logical question to ask would be: What is a programmatic way to store such data in Python?\n",
    "> Fortunately, Pandas developers have already answered that question for us! It's a [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)!\n",
    "\n",
    "DataFrame is a data structure which allows for data to be stored in a tabular format with columns containing different identifying information and rows containing observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this, yet another question might pop into your head: 2D Numpy arrays store data in a tabular format too so what's the difference between them and why should you care for a DataFrame? \n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's answer that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame | 2D Numpy Array\n",
    "--- | ---\n",
    "Heterogenous elements | Homogenous elements\n",
    "Indexed using integers as well as strings (called row labels) | Indexed only using integers\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the abiliy of a DataFrame to store heterogenous elements (a mix of numbers, strings, dates, boolean values etc.) that makes it representative of real-world data and therefore so widely used! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Read data into a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "We've got to talk about one last thing before we can see Pandas in action! On one hand, we have our data **Cans of Beer Sold** stored in a `.csv` file and on the other hand, there's a DataFrame waiting to be used... so how do we connect the dots?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using Pandas `read_csv()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, this method reads data present in a `.csv` file into a DataFrame. Read more about the method [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We have to use the Pandas alias `pd` that was assigned at the time of import to tell the interpreter that we are trying to access the `read_csv()` method from the Pandas library. This is done to avoid confusion between 2 methods with the same name that might belong to different libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Onto our first command!"
