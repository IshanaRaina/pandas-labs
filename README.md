# Pandas

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an extremely powerful open-source Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools and is built on top of NumPy. If you are accessing, manipulating and analysing data with Python, there is no escaping this library!

This course is built in 3 parts, aptly named:

- Baby Pandas
- Teenage Pandas
- Adult Pandas

But there's a twist! :hand_over_mouth:	

Instead of walking you through Pandas from start to finish, we're going to grab hold of a :beer: dataset (why wouldn't it be about beer!) and see what a data analytics project on this dataset would look like, with the use of Pandas. The analysis gets more and more complex as we go along but the highlight here is the analysis being performed on this dataset and how Pandas can be leveraged to implement the crazy things we want to accomplish! 

So put on your best :panda_face: face and let's get to it!
